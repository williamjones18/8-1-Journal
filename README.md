8-1 submission
the purpose of this project is to create pseudocode and a flowchart to plan a coding project.
I wrote the pseudocode clearly and it logically made sense.
I could write more detailed instructions on how to complete each task.
It's difficult to know how much detail to give to pseudocode and how much to leave for the actual algorithm.
making a flowchart is helpful so that nothing gets left out or forgotten.
Proper indentation and comments help make pseudocode and code more readable.
